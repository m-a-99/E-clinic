# E-clinic
During the covid-19 pandemic, increased use of telehealth may be
considered as a risk reduction strategy. Benefits of this strategy
may be conferred to both patients and health providers.
E-Clinic system provides a medical service to the patient by
providing medical advice and health information from the
specialist doctor, as well as providing communication and
support channels for the patient by responding to inquiries,
common questions and medical information. It also provides the
Live video chat feature; this service allows the patient to
communicate with his doctor specialized in audio and video
directly to be diagnosed closely and give the appropriate
treatment and medical advice for this patient.
E-Clinic system Allows the user to create two types of accounts:
1- Doctor's account: this user must have an approved
certificate in one of the medical specialties and has a
government license to work in this field, with all
identification documents required.
2- Patient account: Any person can create a patient account
with his personal information and some information about
his medical history, if any.
